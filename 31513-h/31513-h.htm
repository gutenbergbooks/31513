Introduction
</i>
</p>
<p>
The Wakarusa River rises in the eastern edge of the Flint Hills and flows approximately 50 miles in an easterly direction and empties into the Kansas River near Eudora; with its tributaries, the Wakarusa drains 458 square miles in parts of Wabaunsee, Shawnee, Osage, and Douglas counties of northeastern Kansas (Fig. 1). The average gradient is 6.3 feet per mile. Turbidity is consistently more than 100 ppm in the lower portions of the mainstream and major tributaries, but is usually lower in the upper portions of tributaries. The channel of the mainstream is intrenched in its own alluvium (Dufford, 1958:36) and has high, muddy banks and mud- or sand-bottom; the upper parts of tributaries have lower banks and bottoms of gravel, rubble, or bedrock, although a few (such as Cole Creek) have areas of sandy bottom. A fringe forest of deciduous trees occurs along most streams. The topography and geology of the area have been discussed by Todd (1911), Franzen and Leonard (1943), and Dufford (1958).
</p>
<p>
The five-year period prior to 1957 was the driest in the 70-year history of weather-records in Kansas (Metzler
<i>
et al.</i>, 1958). Streams throughout the Wakarusa Basin suffered intermittency and, according to Mr. Melvon H. Wertzberger, the local Work Unit Conservationist with the Soil Conservation Service, many of them dried completely or contained only a few widely-scattered, stagnant pools. The effect of the drought on stream-flow at the mainstream gaging station 2.1 miles south of Lawrence is presented in Table 1.
</p>
<p>
According to the Division of Sanitation, Kansas State Board of Health, no untreated domestic sewage or industrial waste is discharged into the Wakarusa River System at this time.
</p>
<p>
The Wakarusa Watershed Association is in the preliminary stages of establishing a watershed control project in the basin. Objectives of the project are the improvement of land-use practices and the construction of several headwater retention structures. Such a program should have a long-range effect on the physical and biological characteristics of the streams of the basin. With this in mind we think it important to document the nature of the present fish-fauna and to attempt a historical r&#233;sum&#233; of the fauna, based on collections made in the past sixty years.

Methods
</i>
</p>
<p>
Sodium cyanide, a 110-volt (600-watt) A.C. electric shocker, and seines (6, 12, and 25 feet long, 4 to 8 feet deep having &#188;-in. mesh) were used to collect fish in 1959. All fishes were preserved and examined in the laboratory with the exception of large, common species that were identified in the field and returned to the stream.

Annotated List of Species
</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
Lepisosteus osseus oxyurus</i>
</b>
Rafinesque. DM 2. The longnose gar is abundant in most large rivers of Kansas. The scarcity in the Wakarusa is probably attributable to the small size of the stream.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
Lepisosteus platostomus</i>
</b>
Rafinesque. UMMZ 2. The shortnose gar is common in the Kansas River but seems less inclined than the longnose gar to ascend small streams.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
Dorosoma cepedianum</i>
</b>
(LeSueur). UMMZ 2; DM 1. Gizzard shad.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
Carpiodes velifer</i>
</b>
(Rafinesque). UMMZ 2. This record for the highfin carpsucker is based on a single specimen (UMMZ 63182). It was re-examined by Bernard Nelson who stated (personal communication) "The dorsal fin is broken and the 'pea-lip' smashed. A trace of the 'pea' is still discernible. The body is deeply compressed and other measurements agree with [those of]
<i>
C. velifer</i>. It was identified as
<i>
C. cyprinus
</i>
at first, but later changed by Hubbs."
<i>
C. velifer
</i>
probably was more abundant in Kansas during and before the early 1900's than at present. Several early records of the species are available, but the only specimen obtained in Kansas in recent years was captured in the Neosho River by Deacon in 1958.
</p>
<p>
Moore (1957:80) states that
<i>
C. velifer
</i>
occurs in the clearer rivers and lakes of the Mississippi valley, westward to Nebraska and Oklahoma. The almost complete disappearance of this species from Kansas probably resulted from an increase in turbidity, of the rivers, accompanying settlement and cultivation of the land.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
Carpiodes carpio carpio</i>
</b>
(Rafinesque). KU 5, 12, 15; DM 1, 16, 21, 37. The river carpsucker occurred at stations scattered throughout the drainage, except in the smallest creeks. The largest numbers were found in the lower mainstream.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
Ictiobus cyprinella</i>
</b>
(Valenciennes). KU 10; UMMZ 2; DM 1. The big-mouth buffalo was taken only near the mouth of the river; black buffalo,
<i>
Ictiobus niger
</i>
(Rafinesque) and smallmouth buffalo,

<p>
<b>
<i>
Notropis cornutus frontalis</i>

We found the Topeka shiner in such habitat in Deer Creek, Strowbridge Creek and Burys Creek. The largest population occurred in a tributary of Strowbridge Creek. This stream probably was intermittent in 1958, and Deer and Burys creeks may have been intermittent at some time in 1957-1959. Although Minckley and Cross (1959:215) have stated that Rock Creek is "unsuitable for this species," we suspect that Rock Creek served as a refugium for

<i>
Discussion
</i>
</p>
<p>
Our data show that the present fish-fauna of the Wakarusa River has three major components:
</p>
<p>
(1) A group of species that are mainly restricted to the lower mainstream; all of them are common in the Kansas River (<i>Lepisosteus osseus</i>,
<i>
Carpiodes carpio carpio</i>,
<i>
Ictiobus cyprinella</i>,
<i>
Moxostoma aureolum</i>,
<i>
Cyprinus carpio</i>,
<i>
Hybopsis storeriana</i>,
<i>
Hybopsis aestivalis</i>,
<i>
Notropis percobromus</i>,
<i>
Hybognathus nuchalis
</i>
and
<i>
Pylodictis olivaris)</i>.
</p>
<p>
(2) A group of species that are ubiquitous; they comprised the entire fauna in some tributaries, despite the existence of habitats that seemed suitable for other species (<i>Notropis lutrensis</i>,
<i>
Pimephales promelas</i>,
<i>
Ictalurus melas</i>, and
<i>
Lepomis cyanellus</i>).
</p>
<p>
(3) A group of species having distributions centered in Rock Creek, Washington Creek, Deer Creek, and some nearby tributaries (<i>Catostomus commersonnii</i>,
<i>
Semotilus atromaculatus</i>,
<i>
Hybopsis biguttata</i>,
<i>
Notropis cornutus</i>,
<i>
Notropis topeka</i>,
<i>
Notropis umbratilis</i>,
<i>
Phenacobius mirabilis</i>,
<i>
Pimephales notatus</i>,
<i>
Campostoma anomalum</i>,
<i>
Noturus exilis</i>,
<i>
Percina caprodes</i>,
<i>
Etheostoma nigrum
</i>
and
<i>
Etheostoma spectabile</i>).
</p>
<p>
The distributions of groups (2) and (3) provide clues to the effect of drought on the fish-population, and on the relative ability of various species to repopulate areas where they have been extirpated.
</p>
<p>
Larimore
<i>
et al.
</i>
(1959) studied the re-establishment of stream-fish following drought in Smiths Branch, a small warmwater stream in Illinois. They found that 21 of the 29 species regularly occurring there reinvaded most of the stream-course within two weeks after the resumption of normal flow, and that all but three species were present by the end of the first summer. Our study indicates a much slower rate of dispersal by many of the same species. This is presumably attributable to the ecological barrier presented by the Wakarusa mainstream.
</p>
<p>
During the drought (1952-1956) the mainstream with its turbid water and mud bottom could hardly have served as a refugium for species requiring the clear water and gravel bottom of upland tributaries. Probably the main refugia for these species [group (3)] were in the upper portions of Rock Creek, Washington Creek and possibly Deer Creek. While collecting we observed that these creeks had larger proportions of gravel-rubble bottom, clearer water, deeper pools, and appeared to be more stable than other creeks in the drainage. In Washington Creek, Lone Star Lake enhanced stability of flow.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the drought, fishes in group (3) probably were extirpated or decimated in other tributaries of the Wakarusa. After normal flow recommenced in 1956, fishes re-entered the previously uninhabitable streams or stream-segments. The rate of redispersal by various species probably depended upon their innate mobility, and upon their tolerance of the muddy mainstream of the Wakarusa.
</p>
<p>
Our observations suggest that certain species in group (3) dispersed rapidly from refugia in Rock Creek, Washington Creek, and possibly Deer Creek. These species may, of course, have survived in a few remaining pools in tributaries throughout the basin, thereby necessitating only minor redispersal within these tributaries following drought.
</p>
<p>
Species of group (3) that were most tolerant of drought or that dispersed most rapidly are
<i>
Catostomus commersonnii</i>,
<i>
Notropis umbratilis</i>,
<i>
Pimephales notatus</i>, and
<i>
Percina caprodes</i>; these were present in the uppermost portions of the basin in 1959. Fishes having lesser capacity for survival or dispersal are
<i>
Semotilus atromaculatus</i>,
<i>
Notropis topeka</i>,
<i>
Phenacobius mirabilis
</i>
and
<i>
Campostoma anomalum</i>; in 1959, they were not found farther upstream than Burys Creek.
<i>
Etheostoma spectabile</i>, the orangethroat darter, was taken in Rock Creek, Washington Creek, Deer Creek, Strowbridge Creek, Elk Creek, and at station 24 on the Wakarusa. This is a riffle-dwelling, comparatively sedentary fish, not a strong swimmer. These traits, coupled with the long, muddy pools and infrequent riffles of the Wakarusa mainstream, provide a reasonable explanation of the comparatively slow rate of dispersal by the orangethroat darter.
</p>
<p>
Several species showed no tendency for redispersal following drought, in that they were confined to Washington Creek or Rock Creek in 1959.
<i>
Noturus exilis
</i>
was taken only in Washington Creek immediately below Lone Star Lake. Rock Creek is the last stream in the Wakarusa Basin in which
<i>
Notropis cornutus</i>,
<i>
Hybopsis biguttata
</i>
and
<i>
Etheostoma nigrum
</i>
have survived. These species require comparatively permanent streams having pool-and-riffle habitats and gravelly bottoms for spawning.
<i>
Hybopsis biguttata
</i>
has been recorded only from Rock Creek, where it was last taken in 1924. It is interesting to note that this species had not reinvaded Smiths Branch, in Illinois, three years after the resumption of stream-flow (Larimore
<i>
et al.</i>, 1959).
<i>
Notropis cornutus
</i>
and
<i>
Etheostoma nigrum</i>, although formerly more widespread in the Wakarusa Basin, have been taken recently only in Rock Creek.
</p>
<p>
Faunal changes that have occurred in the basin in the past 60 years indicate a decrease in extent of clear, continuously flowing stream-habitat.
</p>
<p class="head">
<i>
Comparisons with Faunas of Nearby Streams
</i>
</p>
<p>
Minckley (1959) reported 13 species from the Big Blue River Basin that were not taken in our survey of the Wakarusa. Most of the 13 are fishes that probably occur throughout the lower mainstream of the Kansas River and might enter the lower Wakarusa occasionally.
<i>
Chrosomus erythrogaster
</i>
and
<i>
Notropis rubellus
</i>
were reported by Minckley but have not been found in the Kansas River Basin east of the Flint Hills, either in recent or in early collections. On the other hand, five species have been reported from the Wakarusa but not from the Big Blue River. Two of these,
<i>
Notemigonus crysoleucas
</i>
and
<i>
Chaenobryttus gulosus</i>, may have been introduced by man. The remaining three,
<i>
Hybopsis biguttata</i>,
<i>
Noturus exilis
</i>
and
<i>
Percina caprodes</i>, have not been taken farther west than Mill Creek, Wabaunsee County. In general the faunas of the two systems are similar; forty species are common to both.
</p>
<p>
Comparison of the faunal list reported from the Cottonwood River drainage (Arkansas River System) by Cross (1954) with that here reported reveals 26 species in common, 19 found only in the Wakarusa and 15 species found only in the Cottonwood.
